abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) are promising tools for efficient planning and management of vital groundwater resources, especially in data-scarce developing nations. In this study, a standard methodology is proposed to delineate groundwater potential zones using integrated RS, GIS and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques. The developed methodology is demonstrated by a case study in Udaipur district of Rajasthan, western India. Initially, ten thematic layers, viz., topographic elevation, land slope, geomorphology, geology, soil, pre- and post-monsoon groundwater depths, annual net recharge, annual rainfall, and proximity to surface water bodies were considered in this study. These thematic layers were scrutinized by principal component analysis technique to select influential layers for groundwater prospecting. Selected seven thematic layers and their features were assigned suitable weights on the Saaty's scale according to their relative importance in groundwater occurrence. The assigned weights of the thematic layers and their features were then normalized by using AHP (analytic hierarchy process) MCDM technique and eigenvector method. Finally, the selected thematic maps were integrated by weighted linear combination method in a GIS environment to generate a groundwater potential map. Thus, four groundwater potential zones were identified and demarcated in the study area, viz., 'good', 'moderate', 'poor' and 'very poor' based on groundwater potential index values. The area falling in the 'good' zone is about 2,113 km2 (17{\%} of the total study area), which encompasses major portions of Sarada, Salumber, Girwa, Dhariawad, and Mavli blocks of the study area. The northeast and southwest portions along with some scattered patches fall in the 'moderate' zone, which encompasses an area of 3,710 km2 (about 29{\%}). The 'poor' zone is dominant in the study area which covers an area of 4,599 km2 (36{\%} of the total area). The western portion and parts of eastern and southeast portions of the study area are characterized as having 'very poor' groundwater potential, and this zone covers an area of 2,273 km2 (18{\%}). Moreover, in the 'good' zone, the mean annually exploitable groundwater reserve is estimated at 0.026 million cubic metres per km2 (MCM/km2), whereas it is 0. 024 MCM/km2 in the 'moderate' zone, 0.018 MCM/km2 in the 'poor' zone, and 0.013 MCM/km2 in the 'very poor' zone. The groundwater potential map was finally verified using the well yield data of 39 pumping wells, and the result was found satisfactory. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {An approach is presented for the evaluation of groundwater potential
using remote sensing, geographic information system, geoelectrical, and
multi-criteria decision analysis techniques. The approach divides the
available hydrologic and hydrogeologic data into two groups, exogenous
(hydrologic) and endogenous (subsurface). A case study in Salboni Block,
West Bengal (India), uses six thematic layers of exogenous parameters
and four thematic layers of endogenous parameters. These thematic layers
and their features were assigned suitable weights which were normalized
by analytic hierarchy process and eigenvector techniques. The layers
were then integrated using ArcGIS software to generate two groundwater
potential maps. The hydrologic parameters-based groundwater potential
zone map indicated that the `good' groundwater potential zone covers
27.14{\%} of the area, the `moderate' zone 45.33{\%}, and the `poor' zone
27.53{\%}. A comparison of this map with the groundwater potential map
based on subsurface parameters revealed that the hydrologic
parameters-based map accurately delineates groundwater potential zones
in about 59{\%} of the area, and hence it is dependable to a certain
extent. More than 80{\%} of the study area has moderate-to-poor
groundwater potential, which necessitates efficient groundwater
management for long-term water security. Overall, the integrated
technique is useful for the assessment of groundwater resources at a

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available for download (see below).C4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies.This book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses.},

Adaptation and weakness of the State: The case of groundwater scarcity in Ica Abstract Since the end of the 2000s the problem of water scarcity in the Ica river basin has worsened. The factors causing this situation are the strong agro-export growth, the population growth and the climate change effects. Furthermore, public policy since the 90s has promoted private investment and agro-export in the Peruvian coast; and is partially responsible for the shortage of water in Ica and degradation of the aquifers. However, the capacity of the State to deal with the water emergency has relatively neutralized within the existing power relations in Ica; and it presents weakness even for fulfilling its own arrangements like in the case of the restriction of drilling new water wells to guarantee the sustainability of the aquifers.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to produce a groundwater spring potential map of the Sultan Mountains in central Turkey, based on a logistic regression method within a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. Using field surveys, the locations of the springs (440 springs) were determined in the study area. In this study, 17 spring-related factors were used in the analysis: geology, relative permeability, land use/land cover, precipitation, elevation, slope, aspect, total curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, wetness index, stream power index, sediment transport capacity index, distance to drainage, distance to fault, drainage density, and fault density map. The coefficients of the predictor variables were estimated using binary logistic regression analysis and were used to calculate the groundwater spring potential for the entire study area. The accuracy of the final spring potential map was evaluated based on the observed springs. The accuracy of the model was evaluated by calculating the relative operating characteristics. The area value of the relative operating characteristic curve model was found to be 0.82. These results indicate that the model is a good estimator of the spring potential in the study area. The spring potential map shows that the areas of very low, low, moderate and high groundwater spring potential classes are 105.586km2 (28.99{\%}), 74.271km2 (19.906{\%}), 101.203km2 (27.14{\%}), and 90.05km2 (24.671{\%}), respectively. The interpretations of the potential map showed that stream power index, relative permeability of lithologies, geology, elevation, aspect, wetness index, plan curvature, and drainage density play major roles in spring occurrence and distribution in the Sultan Mountains. The logistic regression approach has not yet been used to delineate groundwater potential zones. In this study, the logistic regression method was used to locate potential zones for groundwater springs in the Sultan Mountains. The evolved model was found to be in strong agreement with the available groundwater spring test data. Hence, this method can be used routinely in groundwater exploration under favourable conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The species composition of fragmented semi-natural grasslands may change over time due to stochastic local extinction and colonization events, successional change and/or as a response to changing management or abiotic conditions. The resistance of vegetation to change may be mediated through the effects of topography (slope and aspect) on soils and microclimate. To assess long-term vegetation change in British chalk grasslands, 92 plots first surveyed by F. H. Perring in 1952–53, and distributed across four climatic regions, were re-surveyed during 2001–03. Changes in vegetation since the original survey were assessed by comparing local colonization and extinction rates at the plot scale, and changes in species frequency at the subplot scale. Vegetation change was quantified using indirect ordination (Detrended Correspondence Analysis; DCA) and Ellenberg indicator values. Across all four regions, there was a significant decrease in species number and a marked decline in stress-tolerant species typical of species-rich calcareous grasslands, both in terms of decreased plot occupancy and decreased frequency within occupied plots. More competitive species typical of mesotrophic grasslands had colonized plots they had not previously occupied, but had not increased significantly in frequency within occupied plots. A significant increase in Ellenberg fertility values, which was highly correlated with the first DCA axis, was found across all regions. The magnitude of change of fertility and moisture values was found to decrease with angle of slope and with a topographic solar radiation index derived from slope and aspect. The observed shift from calcareous grassland towards more mesotrophic grassland communities is consistent with the predicted effects of both habitat fragmentation and nutrient enrichment. It is hypothesized that chalk grassland swards on steeply sloping ground are more resistant to invasion by competitive grass species than those on flatter sites due to phosphorus limitation in shallow minerogenic rendzina soils, and that those with a southerly aspect are more resistant due to increased magnitude and frequency of drought events},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Abstract: Satellite derived vegetation indices (VIs) are broadly used in ecological research, ecosystem modeling, and land surface monitoring. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), perhaps the most utilized VI, has countless applications across ecology, forestry, agriculture, wildlife, biodiversity, and other disciplines. Calculating satellite derived NDVI is not always straight-forward, however, as satellite remote sensing datasets are inherently noisy due to cloud and atmospheric contamination, data processing failures, and instrument malfunction. Readily available NDVI products that account for these complexities are generally at coarse resolution; high resolution NDVI datasets are not conveniently accessible and developing them often presents numerous technical and methodological challenges. We address this deficiency by producing a Landsat derived, high resolution (30 m), long-term (30+ years) NDVI dataset for the conterminous United States. We use Google Earth Engine, a planetary-scale cloud-based geospatial analysis platform, for processing the Landsat data and distributing the final dataset. We use a climatology driven approach to fill missing data and validate the dataset with established remote sensing products at multiple scales. We provide access to the composites through a simple web application, allowing users to customize key parameters appropriate for their application, question, and region of interest.},

Thematic maps were prepared using a Hydrogeological Information System. All of the thematic layers were integrated using an ARCVIEW based model, enabling a map showing artificial recharge zones to be generated. Meanwhile, a ground water model, MODFLOW-2001, was used to estimate the effect of such water recharge on the piezometric behavior of the hydrological system. Additionally, these simulations helped manage ground water resources in the study area. The GIS-based demarcation of artificial zones developed in this study was based on logical conditions and reasoning, so that the same techniques, with appropriate modifications, could be adopted elsewhere, especially in similar aquifer systems in arid areas where the occurrence of groundwater is restricted and subject to a greater complexity.

abstract = {Deformation along faults in the shallow crust (b 1 km) introduces permeability heterogeneity and anisotropy, which has an important impact on processes such as regional groundwater flow, hydrocarbon migration, and hy-drothermal fluid circulation. Fault zones have the capacity to be hydraulic conduits connecting shallow and deep geological environments, but simultaneously the fault cores of many faults often form effective barriers to flow. The direct evaluation of the impact of faults to fluid flow patterns remains a challenge and requires a multidisciplinary research effort of structural geologists and hydrogeologists. However, we find that these disciplines often use different methods with little interaction between them. In this review, we document the current multidisciplinary understanding of fault zone hydrogeology. We discuss surface-and subsurface observations from diverse rock types from unlithified and lithified clastic sediments through to carbonate, crystalline, and volcanic rocks. For each rock type, we evaluate geological deformation mechanisms, hydrogeologic observations and conceptual models of fault zone hydrogeology. Outcrop observations indicate that fault zones commonly have a per-meability structure suggesting they should act as complex conduit-barrier systems in which along-fault flow is encouraged and across-fault flow is impeded. Hydrogeological observations of fault zones reported in the literature show a broad qualitative agreement with outcrop-based conceptual models of fault zone hydrogeology. Nevertheless, the specific impact of a particular fault permeability structure on fault zone hydrogeology can only be assessed when the hydrogeological context of the fault zone is considered and not from outcrop observations alone. To gain a more integrated, comprehensive understanding of fault zone hydrogeology, we foresee numerous synergistic opportunities and challenges for the discipline of structural geology and hydrogeology to co-evolve and address remaining challenges by co-locating study areas, sharing approaches and fusing data, developing conceptual models from hydrogeologic data, numerical modeling, and training interdisciplinary scientists.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is widely used as an efficient indicator of vegetation cover. Here, we assess the possibility of using NDVI as an indicator of groundwater storage (GWS). We used groundwater level (GWL) obtained from in‐situ groundwater observation wells (n{\textgreater} 15000) in India in 2005‐2013. Good correlation (r {\textgreater} 0.6) is observed between NDVI and GWL in natural vegetation covered areas, i.e., forest lands, shrubs, and grasslands. We apply artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) approaches to investigate the relationship between GWL and NDVI using both of the parameters as input. ANN and SVM simulated GWL matches very well with observed GWL, particularly in naturally vegetated areas. Thus, we interpret that NDVI may be used as a suitable indicator of GWS conditions in certain areas where the water table is shallow and the vegetation is natural and where in‐situ groundwater observations are not available.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

abstract = {Data analysis and machine learning have become an integrative part of the modern scientific methodology, offering automated procedures for the prediction of a phenomenon based on past observations, unraveling underlying patterns in data and providing insights about the problem. Yet, caution should avoid using machine learning as a black-box tool, but rather consider it as a methodology, with a rational thought process that is entirely dependent on the problem under study. In particular, the use of algorithms should ideally require a reasonable understanding of their mechanisms, properties and limitations, in order to better apprehend and interpret their results. Accordingly, the goal of this thesis is to provide an in-depth analysis of random forests, consistently calling into question each and every part of the algorithm, in order to shed new light on its learning capabilities, inner workings and interpretability. The first part of this work studies the induction of decision trees and the construction of ensembles of randomized trees, motivating their design and purpose whenever possible. Our contributions follow with an original complexity analysis of random forests, showing their good computational performance and scalability, along with an in-depth discussion of their implementation details, as contributed within Scikit-Learn. In the second part of this work, we analyse and discuss the interpretability of random forests in the eyes of variable importance measures. The core of our contributions rests in the theoretical characterization of the Mean Decrease of Impurity variable importance measure, from which we prove and derive some of its properties in the case of multiway totally randomized trees and in asymptotic conditions. In consequence of this work, our analysis demonstrates that variable importances [...].},

abstract = {We have developed two nonlinear time-series models for predicting groundwater level (GWL) fluctuations using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). The models were applied to GWL prediction of two wells at a coastal aquifer in Korea. Among the possible variables (past GWL, precipitation, and tide level) for an input structure, the past GWL was the most effective input variable for this study site. Tide level was more frequently selected as an input variable than precipitation. The results of the model performance show that root mean squared error (RMSE) values of ANN models are lower than those of SVM in model training and testing stages. However, the overall model performance criteria of the SVM are similar to or even better than those of the ANN in model prediction stage. The generalization ability of a SVM model is superior to an ANN model for input structures and lead times. The uncertainty analysis for model parameters detects an equifinality of model parameter sets and higher uncertainty for ANN model than SVM in this case. These results imply that the model-building process should be carefully conducted, especially when using ANN models for GWL forecasting in a coastal aquifer. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Groundwater is considered as the most important natural resources in arid and semi-arid regions. In this study, the application of random forest (RF) and maximum entropy (ME) models for groundwater potential mapping is investigated at Mehran Region, Iran. Although the RF and ME models have been applied widely to environmental and ecological modeling, their applicability to other kinds of predictive modeling such as groundwater potential mapping has not yet been investigated. About 163 groundwater data with high potential yield values of ≥11m3/h were obtained from Iranian Department of Water Resources Management (IDWRM). Further, these selected wells were randomly divided into a dataset 70{\%} (114 wells) for training and the remaining 30{\%} (49 wells) was applied for validation purposes. In total, ten groundwater conditioning factors that affect the storage of groundwater occurrences (e.g. altitude, slope percent, slope aspect, plan curvature, drainage density, distance from rivers, topographic wetness index (TWI), landuse, lithology, and soil texture) were used as input to the models. Subsequently, the RF and ME models were applied to generate the groundwater potential maps (GPMs). Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was used to identify the impact of variable uncertainties on the produced GPMs. Finally, the results of the GPMs were quantitatively validated using observed groundwater dataset and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method. Area under ROC curve (AUC) was used to compare the performance of RF with ME. The uncertainty on the preparation of conditioning factors was taken in account to enhance the model. The validation results showed that the AUC for success rate of RF and ME models was 86.5 and 91{\%}, respectively. In contrast, the AUC for prediction rate of RF and ME methods was obtained 83.1 and 87.7{\%}, respectively. Therefore, RF and ME were found to be effective models for groundwater potential mapping.},

abstract = {s u m m a r y Accurate and reliable groundwater level forecasting models can help ensure the sustainable use of a watershed's aquifers for urban and rural water supply. In this paper, a new method based on coupling discrete wavelet transforms (WA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) for groundwater level forecasting applications is proposed. The relative performance of the proposed coupled wavelet-neural network models (WA-ANN) was compared to regular artificial neural network (ANN) models and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for monthly groundwater level forecasting. The variables used to develop and validate the models were monthly total precipitation, average temperature and average groundwater level data recorded from November 2002 to October 2009 at two sites in the Chateau-guay watershed in Quebec, Canada. The WA-ANN models were found to provide more accurate monthly average groundwater level forecasts compared to the ANN and ARIMA models. The results of the study indicate the potential of WA-ANN models in forecasting groundwater levels. It is recommended that additional studies explore this proposed method, which can be used in turn to facilitate the development and implementation of more effective and sustainable groundwater management strategies.},

abstract = {One of the open problems in nuclear structure is how to predict properties of finite nuclei from the knowledge of a bare nucleon-nucleon interaction of the meson-exchange type. We point out that a promising starting point consists in Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (DBHF) calculations us- ing realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions like the Bonn potentials, which are able to reproduce satisfactorily the properties of symmetric nuclear matter without the need for 3-body forces, as is necessary in non-relativistic BHF calculations. However, the DBHF formalism is still too com- plicated to be used directly for finite nuclei. We argue that a possible route is to define effective Lagrangians with density-dependent nucleon-meson coupling vertices, which can be used in the Relativistic Hartree (or Relativistic Mean Field (RMF)) or preferrably in the Relativistic Hartree- Fock (RHF) approach. The density-dependence is matched to the nuclear matter DBHF results. We review the present status of nuclear matter DBHF calculations and discuss the various schemes to construct the self-energy, which lead to differences in the predictions. We also discuss how effective Lagrangians have been constructed and are used in actual calculations. We point out that completely consistent calculations in this scheme still have to be performed.},

abstract = {To study the Earth system and to better understand the implications of global environmental change, there is a growing need for large-scale hydrographic data sets that serve as prerequisites in a variety of analyses and applications, ranging from regional watershed and freshwater conservation planning to global hydrological, climate, biogeochemical, and land surface modeling. Yet while countless hydrographic maps exist for well-known river basins and individual nations, there is a lack of seamless high-quality data on large scales such as continents or the entire globe. Data for many large international basins are patchy, and remote areas are often poorly mapped.In response to these limitations, a team of scientists has developed data and created maps of the world's rivers that provide the research community with more reliable information about where streams and watersheds occur on the Earth's surface and how water drains the landscape. The new product, known as HydroSHEDS (Hydrological Data and Maps Based on Shuttle Elevation Derivatives at Multiple Scales), provides this information at a resolution and quality unachieved by previous global data sets, such as HYDRO1k [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), 2000].},

abstract = {Urban growth is increasing the demand for freshwater resources, yet surprisingly the water sources of the world's large cities have never been globally assessed, hampering efforts to assess the distribution and causes of urban water stress. We conducted the first global survey of the large cities' water sources, and show that previous global hydrologic models that ignored urban water infrastructure significantly overestimated urban water stress. Large cities obtain 78±3{\%} of their water from surface sources, some of which are far away: cumulatively, large cities moved 504 billion liters a day (184km 3 yr -1 ) a distance of 27,000±3800km, and the upstream contributing area of urban water sources is 41{\%} of the global land surface. Despite this infrastructure, one in four cities, containing {\$}4.8±0.7 trillion in economic activity, remain water stressed due to geographical and financial limitations. The strategic management of these cities' water sources is therefore important for the future of the global economy. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

@article{Israil2006,
abstract = {A Geographical Information System (GIS) has been used for the integration of the results of 70 vertical electrical soundings and hydrogeological data in the piedmont zone of the Himalayan foothills region of Uttaranchal, India. Indian remote sensing (IRS) LISS-III data has been used to prepare thematic maps for the geomorphology and slope maps of the area. The ranges of electrical resistivity values have been assigned to the different formations by calibrating electrical resistivity values with the borehole data. Electrical resistivity, groundwater level monitoring, and borehole and remote sensing data have been integrated in the GIS analysis to delineate the hydrogeological zoning in the study area. Suitable weights were assigned to the different features affecting the groundwater potential. The total score for a particular location is translated in terms of groundwater potential of the area. The results indicate that the southern part of the study area has a very good groundwater potential for meeting the demand of water for irrigation and domestic purposes whereas the steeply sloping area in the northern part, having high relief, has a poor groundwater potential. The resulting delineation of groundwater potential zones are in general agreement with the available yield data of the tube wells. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

@article{Ahmed2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences. The study explored potential of groundwater in the Lower Barpani watershed of Assam, India. Ten site-specific groundwater factors in the watershed were assigned weights through analytical hierarchy process. The weighted factors were integrated to prepare groundwater potential zones in GIS environment. Results revealed that the northern and northwestern parts of the study area have high groundwater potential. Gentle slope, flood plain, monsoon rainfall and location of numerous wetlands were found to be the major factors of high potential of groundwater in these parts. Medium groundwater potential was found in the southern part of the watershed. High drainage density but comparatively steeper slopes, nature of rocks and low water table have made this part of the watershed to have medium potential for groundwater. Low groundwater potential zone was identified mostly in the southwestern parts of the study area. Steep slope, high rate of runoff and low permeability due to hard rocks were found to be the main factors of low groundwater potential in these parts. Validation of groundwater potential zones with water yield revealed a strong positive relationship. Density of population and groundwater potential were positively correlated, and about 93{\%} variation (r2 = 0.937) in density of population is explained by variation in groundwater potential. A linear correlation between groundwater zones and density of population suggests dependence of population on availability of groundwater. The methodology adopted in this study can be used for monitoring groundwater prospects for sustainable development and management of water resources in different geographical regions at various scales.},
